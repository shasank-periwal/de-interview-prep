## **Communication Transformation**

**Instead of:** "I did check out the company's profile..."

**Try:** "I'm excited about [X]'s mission to build vertical AI for women's empowerment. Having researched your B2B model and the challenges of bias in feminist data, I see clear parallels to demographic bias issues I've addressed in financial data pipelines..."

## Money 

I'm excited about blah blah.

You have already evaluated me. Let me know where do I fit in your budget because there are certain industry standard and certain grades and scales on the role that you have offered and now that you have evaluated me so let me know where I fit
How can we make this work
How can we close this gap
it seems like

Thank you for the opportunity. I’m excited about the role. Given my [X] years of relevant experience and the fixed offer I currently have, would you be able to match or exceed the [Y] LPA offer so I can make a confident decision?

Thank you for the opportunity. I'm genuinely excited about the role and the technical challenges it offers. After our discussions, I've been evaluating this opportunity alongside my current market options. I have a competing offer of [Y] LPA fixed, which reflects the current market value for my AWS and data engineering expertise in the BFSI domain.

I understand my current compensation might seem low, but that's precisely why I'm exploring market opportunities. The [Y] LPA offer I have validates that my skills are significantly undervalued in my current role. I'm not looking for an incremental raise - I'm seeking fair market compensation

## EXTRAS 

Given the constraints we discussed, I was hoping for [X-Y] LPA range, or if that's not possible, [Z] LPA with the service bond removed.

I have another offer at [X] LPA with better terms and no service bond. I prefer your opportunity, but the package gap is significant. What can you do to make this easier for me to accept?

I appreciate the salary adjustment. However, the service bond remains a significant concern. If we're moving forward with the bond, could we at least reduce the penalty to 1 month salary and shorten the duration to 3 months? Or alternatively, add a clause that waives the penalty if the company initiates termination?

Thank you for taking the time to discuss this. I'm genuinely excited about the Data Engineer role and the opportunity to work with [mention specific tech/project if you know]. I've reviewed the offer thoroughly, and I'd like to have an open conversation about the compensation package

I have another offer at [X] LPA with better terms - specifically no service bond, clearer benefits including comprehensive health insurance for family, and more flexible leave policy. I'm more interested in your opportunity because of sense of ownership that I'll get, but the gap in overall package is making this decision difficult.

and the benefit uncertainties, the effective value of both packages isn't comparable.

I want to join your team, but I need to make the right choice for my career and family.
